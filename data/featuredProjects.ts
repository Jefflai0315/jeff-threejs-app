The processed data is then used for a series of text analysis such as sentiment analysis, text transformation, text generation, summarization of keywords among others. The result is a list of design opportunities for spatial heater which are then sent to the product owner or designer to review.",

        "category": "Product Design Studio",
        "description": "From defining problem statements to prototyping, our team was able to create a fully functional dispensing machine prototype for Meiban and Zhongjing TCM. Our prototype showed a proof of concept for meeting 3 metrics - Speed, Location accuracy and Weight precision. The machine was able to dispense powder in a controlled manner and the workers were able to manipulate the order virtually. It was categorized as a B2B product that can be integrated into the TCM brewing process to reduce human labor, improve accuracy and efficiency. It is designed to be scalable to meet our clients’ needs.",

Our hypothesis is to use generative design with appropriate material to maintain the structural integrity while saving energy cost during operations. In this project we Make our very own true-to-size crank machine mode with Fusion 360l, Analyze research papers on maximum digging force, Used state-of-the-art Fusion 360 generative design tools to develop and analyze our dipper-arm model. The end result is the blueprint of a more sustainable dipper-arm ready to be exported. ",

        "description": "I have a De’Longhi EC680 espresso machine that I used to make latte every single morning. As a daily user who likes to alter among different beans, I have to press and hold the dispensing button until the desired weight has shown on the weighing scale in order to obtain the correct consistency of the espresso. However, the time waiting could allow me to prepare the pitcher and milk. Hence, I have made a helper arm and weighing scale that communicate with each other through Arduino. The system automate the dispensing of espresso accurately. In addition, since I am using a Maker Wifi version of arduino, I am able to track and upload my espresso flow profiling data to Firebase, which I can then use to display on a chart with my Streamlit web app.",

As a freelance artist and a coffee lover, I made it a platform for me to share my artwork and coffee habits, where the public can leave comments for interaction. The scripts are fully written in Python which is an efficacious way for me to host an interactive web app with minimum web deployment knowledge. Within a short time frame, I was able to write the code for an interactive application, present a real-time chart for data-visualization and integrate Google Sheet APIs into my application.",
